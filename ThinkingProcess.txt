First, I will set up the project and then

I will mock the UI so can get an idea of how it should look.
You can find a simple mock the app in the ui-mocks folder

With that done, I will start to code the UI.

Now that the feed is ready, I will fetch the posts data.
I will assume I can only use the url specified in the instructions:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments


With the feed done, I need to show the comments related to an specific posts. 
For that I will use a different component 
and also I will use react-router for basic navigation.


The URL: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments
gives me all the comments mixed, my solution to that will be 
to filter the comments by postId
The optimal approach would have been and endpoint like:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments?postId=5
But let's stick to it.

After styling the components a bit, the feed its and you can see the comments.

Now, I will set up redux in its actions.
I will store the posts and the comments in Redux once I fetch them just 
to take advantage of the storage.
Also, I will create a UserInSession to simulate a logged user.
Now I can add comments and they will be stored in Redux 
and displaying them is fairly easy the usage of useSelector.
Another approach could have been making API calls every time
and storing in Redux just the comments made by the user, that way I could fetch the comments
and combine them with user comments of the posts with some filters and spread operators.
